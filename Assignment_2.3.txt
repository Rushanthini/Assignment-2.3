Explain in detail:
* Each component of Hadoop 1.x

*The major components are HDFS and MapReduce.
*They are known as pillars of Hadoop 1.x.
*Hadoop system is a master/slave architecture.
*Hadoop 1.x file system has 64MB block size.
*The default replication factor is 3 which is configurable.
*There are total 5 components 
                   1. NameNode
                   2.DataNode
                   3.Secondary NameNode
                   4.JobTracker
                   5.TaskTracker

*NameNode, DataNode and Secondary NameNode are called as storage components.
*JobTracker and TaskTracker are called as processing components.

NameNode:
*The job of the NameNode is to decide how to store the physical location of each and evert file in blocks of the clusters.
*It also manages the metadata of the files stored.
*NameNode always stores metadata in FSImage and EditLogs file periodically. This process is called as Checkpoint mechanism.

DataNode:
*DataNode stores the file data in blocks.
*It sends the RPC signal periodically to notify the NameNode that it is alive and working.

Secondary NameNode:
*It acts as the backbone of the NameNode.
*It stores the metadata details from NameNode periodically as per chechpoint mechanism.
*When the NameNode goes down, the Secondary NameNode comes into action and acts as the temporary NameNode till the NameNode
becomes active again.

JobTracker:
*It resides in the same node as of NameNode.
*Its job is to assign jobs to the DataNodes or TaskTrackers.
*It also decides the job scheduling for the DataNodes or TaskTrakers.
*In case of failure, it decides about the rescheduling of the task to some other nodes. 

TaskTracker:
*Its job is to execute the task assigned by the JobTracker.
